To do most of the testing we need to be able to login.
Doing this manually for each test would be tedious and defeat the point of automated testing.

There are a few ways to do this, (Cypress strongly discourages using 3rd party elements when testing):
    - Create a command that will request a token from the Auth0 client and use that to authenticate
    - Create a stub that will return a false verification.

I opted for the first option and have created a command in 'cypress/support/commands.js' called 'login'
There are secrets required for the request which are stored in 'cypress.env.json' which I've added to .gitignore
so that they won't be pushed to GitHub.

I need some details about our Auth0 setup for Clarity which I guess SRE might have?
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret

For the purposes of logging in we should also create a dummy google account (w/o MFA for simplicity)
and save the username and password in the local env file.
